							<h2 class="eye-test">Lasik</h2>
							<p class="text-secondary">LASIK eye surgery is the best known and most commonly performed laser refractive surgery to correct vision problems. Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) can be an alternative to glasses or contact lenses. During LASIK surgery, a special type of cutting laser is used to precisely change the shape of the dome-shaped clear tissue at the front of your eye (cornea) to improve vision. In eyes with normal vision, the cornea bends (refracts) light precisely onto the retina at the back of the eye. But with nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia) or astigmatism, the light is bent incorrectly, resulting in blurred vision. Glasses or contact lenses can correct vision, but reshaping the cornea itself also will provide the necessary refraction.</p>
							<p class="text-secondary">Dr. Ajajy Mehta brings in years of experience and dedication to Lasik eye surgery India, having treated thousands of individuals in Lasik eye surgery India and overseas across different age groups and strata of society. When one looks out for Lasik eye surgery in Gujarat Rajkot, Keshubhai Mehta Eye Hospital is the best location to lay all your trust in.</p>

							<h2 class="eye-test2">Why Get Your Glasses Removed Here</h2>
							<p class="text-secondary">Advanced: The SCHWIND AMARIS is a superfast Excimer laser with a 0.54 mm Super Gaussian profile at true 500 Hz repetition rate.<br><br>

								It is the first laser to have dual and automatic fluency adjustment (high and low fluency levels accordingly with the planned correction). The first laser with a 1050 Hz turbo eye tracker considering static and dynamic cyclotorsion and detection of both iris and limbus.<br><br>

								Multifunctional: Can perform “Aberration-Free” treatments, ocular wave front treatments, and corneal wave front treatments.<br><br>

								Accurate View: There is a high resolution stereoscopic microscope; slit focusing illumination integrated a slit lamp and dual operating systems.<br><br>

								Reliable: The particle aspiration system gives a totally stable climate around the eye that makes the system fully independent from the environmental conditions and air flow, a bugbear with all the older model lasers which simply use vacuum.<br><br>

								Intelligent: The Amaris uses three high powered computer with built-in features that make this machine very smart and user friendly, with software that is very advanced giving a perfect correction.<br><br>

							Safe: The knowledge, the experience and the results of thousands of cases with the SCHWIND-CAM software, are used and built into the SCHWIND AMARIS profiles. This means exceptional results even in very demanding difficult cases</p>

							<h2 class="eye-test2">No Touch Lasser Treatment - First In Gujarat</h2>
							<p class="text-secondary">Only Eye hospital in Gujarat doing touchless smart surface LASER surgery.</p>
							<p class="text-secondary">SmartSurfACE  is an advanced surgery that involves the removal of the epithelium of the eye, without suction, flap or blade, or without the use of alcohol. It is used to treat myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism and reduces dependency on contact lenses and glasses. It is one of the quickest vision correction procedures and preferred over the LASIK ,AND SMILE surgery by many as it eliminates the risk of potential complications and is suitable even for those with thin corneas and high myopia.</p>
							<p class="text-secondary">
								<ul class="text-secondary">
									<li>Simple and fast one-step procedure, taking only 3-5 minutes for each eye.</li>
									<li>The absence of a corneal flap eliminates any flap-related medical condition.</li>
									<li>Suitable for those with an active lifestyle, particularly those participating in contact sports.</li>
									<li>A safer option for those with high-risk jobs such as air force pilots, military personnel, navy divers and more.</li>
									<li>An alternative for those who are not suitable for LASIK due to a thin cornea and high myopia.</li>
									<li>Minimal risk of dry eye, a common side effect of LASIK eye surgery.</li>

							<h2 class="eye-test2 mt-3">Smart Surface Procedure</h2>
							<p class="text-secondary mt-3">It is a simple and fast procedure that utilises the high-tech Schwind Amaris 500 excimer laser – the world’s fastest laser machine. This machine is equipped with a zero latency tracker, allowing for safe and accurate treatment.</p>
							<p class="text-secondary">The procedure does not involve any surgical instrument touching the eye. First, the Schwind Amaris 500 laser starts off by removing the epithelium cells. Next, the laser reshapes the curvature of the cornea in a single step to correct refractive power. Once the cornea has been reshaped, a soft contact lens acting as an artificial cornea flap is placed over the cornea to protect it during the healing process.</p>
							<p class="text-secondary">It takes about 3 to 5 days for the epithelium cells to regenerate. After 5 days, the contact lenses are removed. To facilitate the healing process, patients are required to keep away from strong sunlight and use prescription eye drops for 6 to 10 weeks after the procedure. Full visual recovery typically takes about one to three months.</p>

							<h2 class="eye-test2 mt-3">Topography Guided Lasik</h2>
							<p class="text-secondary mt-3">First, Dr Ajay Mehta uses an instrument called a topographer. Then the topographer takes thousands of measurements across your entire cornea. These measurements provide a detailed map that includes any irregularities on your cornea’s surface.</p>
							<p class="text-secondary">Topography-guided LASIK surgery is customized laser vision correction surgery. Currently, this custom LASIK technology is the most advanced form available. topography-guided LASIK eye surgery can deliver higher quality vision.</p>
